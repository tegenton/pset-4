/**
 * INSTRUCTIONS.
 * 
 * Welcome to Problem Set 4, where we'll dive into writing our own methods with
 * parameters and return values. The focus, this time, will be on the built-in @String
 * and @Math classes.
 * 
 * You'll note that most of the methods have not been included. Instead, you'll see
 * specifications pertaining to their signatures (i.e., the method name, as well as
 * its return type and parameter list). You'll need to be sure to meet these
 * specifications exactly.
 * 
 * As always, please be mindful of your output (in this case, returned values rather
 * than printed text). Your solutions will be tested against a set of expected
 * values, and the grading script will expect an exact match.
 * 
 * This problem set contains 10 exercises worth 50 points. It is due no later than
 * 11:59pm on Sunday, November 4, 2018. Good luck!
